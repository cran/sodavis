Description: Variable and interaction selection are essential to classification in high-dimensional setting. In this package, we provide the implementation of SODA procedure, which is a forward-backward algorithm that selects both main and interaction effects under logistic regression and quadratic discriminant analysis. We also provide an extension, S-SODA, for dealing with the variable selection problem for semi-parametric models with continuous responses.
